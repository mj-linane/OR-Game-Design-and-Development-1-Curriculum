## Defining Core Game Mechanics and Meaningful Play

**What are players** ***actually doing?*** Designing a game is designing an *activity* – something that fills up the time your players spend for seconds, minutes, hours, days, even years. While some may think about games in terms of their visual aesthetics or narrative content, the fact that a game is a dynamic system with which players interact defines what is unique about games as an expressive form. Game designers have to create an activity with which players engage, from moment to moment, over time. A question designers need to ask themselves is: what are your players *actually doing* to fill their time as they play?

**A repeated activity.** For most games, the activity of play boils down to a fairly repetitive activity or set of activities – the ***core mechanics*** of a game. The core mechanic of the sport of Sculling is rowing a boat. The core mechanics of Poker are drawing cards, playing cards, and betting. The core mechanic of Starcraft is using the mouse and keyboard to issue commands to your units.

**Making activity meaningful.** An important part of game design is to make the core mechanic of your particular game meaningful. Whether it is reading text and clicking on links, moving through a 3D space, or moving pawns on a gameboard grid – how can you make *that* activity meaningful? Giving a player meaningful choice means providing a context for players to know what their choices are, to be able to choose one option out of several, and to understand how their choice has affected the state of the game.

**Action and Outcome.** As players play a game, they make many small decisions – whether the decisions are made in real-time, as in a sport or action videogame, or whether they are happening discretely, as in a strategy game where play happens in turns. Each ***action*** a player takes has some kind of ***outcome*** in the game. These action/outcome moments are the molecules of meaningful play. Gameplay is the moment-to-moment experience of these small pearls of decisions, strung together to extend across longer periods of play.

**Designing a context of meaning.** A game design should provide a context in which every player choice is meaningful. If a Chess set is sitting on a coffee table as merely a conversation piece, moving one of the pieces on the grid doesn’t really change that much. But if a game is in session, it suddenly matters very much exactly which piece you move, and when, and where. What does an action *mean* in the game – how does its outcome ramify over time? A player’s action becomes meaningful in the context of the game. The game is the context that helps to provide meaning for the action.

**Breakdowns in meaning.** Meaningful play is often most evident when it doesn’t work. You have a hand of cards and it seems like it doesn’t matter which one you play; you raise taxes on your virtual city and you never really understand the outcome of that choice; your character died and you don’t know why – all of these moments represent breakdowns when a game fails to provide meaningful play.

**A space of possibility.** When it does work, the meaningful play gives players expansive spaces of possibility – sets of choices and outcomes that represent interesting possible ways to play the game. This is what makes players want to try a game again – to see how their choices might play out differently if they attempt new approaches. A game design should give players spaces of possibility that they can explore in their own individual ways.

## Examples of Game Mechanics

- **Territorial Acquisition**. These games are often zero-sum games, where the players fight over a limited amount of territory or resources. Think about Risk, for example.
- **Prediction**. Often you find this core in party games or gambling games and luck is involved in making a prediction. Roulette is an example of this.
- **Spatial Reasoning**. Often you need to consider how your game pieces work together to create a successful winning strategy. An example of this core is Tetris.
- **Survival**. This core banks on our natural instincts to survive and is found in many action games. An example is Dark Souls.
- **Destruction**. A game with this core allows players to wreck havoc on most things in the game. It is very common in first-person shooters.
- **Building**. The building and use of structures is a core of many games. Good examples are Sim City and Minecraft.
- **Collection**. The need to collect, own and match things is deeply ingrained in humans. This is a popular core mechanic in many board games and casual games (Match 3).
- **Chasing or Evading**. This appeals to our fight-or-flight response and often works as a driving core in games. An example is Pac-Man.
- **Trading**. This a very cooperative game core. Sometimes, players want to exchange resources and negotiate the values with one another. The most common example is the board game Settlers of Catan.
- **Race-to-the-end**. This core dynamic is very simple to implement and you have already created a Race-to-the-end game in your first homework assignment. It is very common in children’s games.
