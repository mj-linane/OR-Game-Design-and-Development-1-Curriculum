- Resolves its uncertainty in an unequal outcome.

### Game Elements

1. *Players*: How many? Any requirements? Special knowledge, roles etc?
2. *Objectives*: What is the objective of the game?
3. *Procedures*: What are the special actions of play that are allowed by the rules? (Ex. Who decides turn order? What are the controls? How are teams created? team colors?)
4. *Rules*: Any limits on player actions? Rules regarding behavior? What are they?
5. *Resources:* Any items needed by the player to reach the objective? What are they?
6. *Conflict*: What causes conflict in this game?
7. *Boundaries*: What are the boundaries of the game? Are they physical? Conceptual?
8. *Outcome*: What are the potential outcomes of the game?
9. *Challenge*: What creates challenge in the game?
10. *Play*: Is there a sense of play within the rules of the game?
11. *Premise/Character/Story:* Are these present?


## First Game Design

### Goal

Design a game using the given backstory and the questions that follow.

### Setup/Backstory

1. Player starts on a plane.
2. Player jumps out of plane/plane crashes and player lands on one of a series of islands.

### Design Questions

1. What experience/emotions do you want your players to have?
2. What is the playerâ€™s goal?
3. What/who is going to prevent the player from achieving that goal? How are they going to do that?

### Design Tips

1. Really focus on the first question: the experience of the player.
2. If you are stuck for ideas, consider: when, where would this event happen in real life?
3. Draft a couple of ideas before you settle on one. Donâ€™t let the first idea be the only idea.

### When done answering questions

1. Start to draft some of the rules of the game.
2. If you are far enough along, start play and see if the game is actually any fun ðŸ™‚
