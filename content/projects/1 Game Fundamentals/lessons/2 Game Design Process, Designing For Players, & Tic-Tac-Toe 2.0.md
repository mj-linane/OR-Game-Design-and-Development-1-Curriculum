> 

## Actvities

1. Discussion - What Makes A Game Bad Game
2. Play Tic Tac Toe & List Rules
3. Introduce TicTacToe 2.0
    1. I told students that they will be redesigning a game, Tic-Tac-Toe
        1. We listed off the rules to tic-tac-toe on the board
            1. 3x3 board
            2. one player at a time goes
            3. puts a piece down on an empty space
            4. 3 in a row wins
            5. when no one moves, it ends in a draw
            6. players have 2 different colored icons
    2. Students then were asked to modify the game to modify the game for:
        1. 3-5 players
        2. Try to change as few rules as possible
        3. Try to keep it looking like Tic-Tac-Toe
    3. Deliverable: List of Game Rules for Tic-Tac-Toe from group of 3
4. Cover the game development cycle iterations in the Game Lab page (10 minutes)
5. Iterative Design & Discussion (With your partner, identify what makes iterative game design such a good strategy to design good games?)  I tell students that this will be the tool they will be using to design their games going forward
6. Go over how to Designing For Players
7. Tic Tac Toe Design Time
