Overview
--------

In this lesson you will start to complete a final project.

Options for Final Projects
--------------------------

### 1. Modification of Existing Game (Least Challenging)

Take a game that you have made this year and add on additional levels, assets, gameplay functionality. Suboptions here could could vary widely but some examples are:

- Additional level design
- Adding in additional assets or replacing assets already in the Unity Store.
- Adding in additional user interface elements such as score reporting.
- Adding in additional sound or lighting for environmental

This option would further your skills in creating immersive environments. The focus is on designing the best space possible for the player. This is the only option that does not strictly require coding/scripting. Key components here would be:

1. Appropriately sized environment
2. Environment Attention to Detail (Terrain, Flora, and Game object placement)
3. Audio
4. Lighting

In this option, you will work to test out an original game concepts. There is less of a focus here on game polish and you should not use a lot of Unity Assets. The game will consist mainly of primitive shapes and prototype objects. This should solely focus on testing a game idea, not building a final project.

#### Options for Group Work

If you choose option 3, you may work with another person(s) to complete your final project. If you do, I require that you and your team meet with me during Bulldog Block to go over final project goals and how to source control your project.
