# Freeplay Instructions

Its a Freeplay Day! Freeplay Days are a chance for you to experiment with your own original game designs with the Unity Game engine.

We will have multiple Freeplay days during this course so you can start a project now to be continued later, on another day.

## Acceptable Activities

1. **Microgame Expansion:** Continue modifying one of your microgames.
2. **Learning Project:** Go to Unity Hub > Learn > Pick a beginner project to build over the course of several Freeplay days.
3. **Level Design:** Start a new project, pick assets from the unity store with Unity Store Assets.
4. **Micro Skill Builder:** Pick a series of videos from [Brackey's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Brackeys/search?query=how%20to) to build a specific skill such as: ["How To Make A Healthbar In Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLfNP4Sc_iA).
5. **Build Game Assets:** Know how to draw? Know how to 3D model? You can use this day to build or own pixel art or 3D designs.

## Deliverable

The deal with Freeplay days is that you get the freedom to explore but...you need to deliver something. You need to produce something. Watching a bunch of videos or spending your time just downloading assets is not enough.

How can you tell if you have produced something? If you can't give or sell what you made to someone else, or you can't have someone playtest it, then you haven't produced anything.

## Submission

Submit at least one screenshot of your final product to the assignment on Google Classroom.
