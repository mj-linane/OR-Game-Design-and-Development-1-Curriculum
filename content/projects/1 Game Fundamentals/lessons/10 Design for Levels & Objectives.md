# Design for Levels & Objectives

## Warm Up

Students begin with the question: If we were going to make a 1st or 3rd person shooting game into a board game, would we need to change anything about how levels were setup?*

## Activity #1 Draft Objectives

Students copy document game #2 and draft out thier first experience.

1. Remind them: A game is: Voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.
2. In Your Google Doc called your Game Design Journal
    1. Go over information about designing for objectives
    2. Students spend a couple of minutes completing the chart.
    3. When finished, they pair-share
    4. Share out as a class
3. Cover objectives and then have them discuss which might work best for their game
    1. Pick one for the chart

## Activity #2 Draft Levels

1. Go over level design options
    1. drafting images on the board

## Idea

## **Team Building Game #17: Watch Where You Step**

Using masking tape, create a large polygonal shape on the floor. It should be about 12 feet long by 6 feet wide, at least. Mark the start and stopping points. Make the shape a bit convoluted, choosing a shape that is elongated with the idea that people must make their way from one end to the other. Place a few squeaky dog toys inside the shape, and twice as many full sheets of paper with a large X on them inside the shape. The paper is the mines.

At least two at a time, each person on your team must make their way from start to finish blindfolded. They cannot step outside of the boundary, nor can they step on a mine. If they do, they are frozen. They can only be unfrozen if someone else inside the shape steps on a squeak toy. Their only guidance is the vocal commands of those outside the shape who are not blindfolded.

**Purpose:**Â This game is about communication, and trusting each other. Players learn to be observant of multiple action as well as give clear and timely advice.
