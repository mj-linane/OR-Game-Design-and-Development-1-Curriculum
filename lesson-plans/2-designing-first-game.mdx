## History of Gameplay

### Playing Games Is Natural

Playing games is a part of the human nature. How do we know? Small infants can play games. Dogs play games. [Fish play games.](http://techtimes.com/articles/18344/20141021/fish-play-for-fun-study.htm)

### Board Game Formalization

Oldest board game in the world? [Senet](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Senet). Originates from ancient Egypt, 3100 BC.

## Survival Game Design

### Goal

Design a game using the given backstory and the questions that follow.

### Setup/Backstory

1. Player starts on a plane.
2. Player jumps out of plane/plane crashes and player lands on one of a series of islands.

![Starting Islands](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/rUT2IvvoGchUKgQcYrc7eLHSBxYveCz9LPq6U_LtUyOurThTSA9cy3Preuz0ELq1Mmvm6ZKfARWGrlptniEJV3jbt3tIREyq9k1pm38UbADzLPXsP9xkiECzibz39yAGh5R0g9q0)
*Starting Islands*

### Design Questions

1. What experience/emotions do you want your players to have?
2. What is the playerâ€™s goal?
3. What/who is going to prevent the player from achieving that goal? How are they going to do that?

### Design Tips

1. Really focus on the first question: the experience of the player.
2. If you are stuck for ideas, consider: when, where would this event happen in real life?
3. Draft a couple of ideas before you settle on one. Donâ€™t let the first idea be the only idea.

### When done answering questions

1. Start to draft some of the rules of the game.
2. If you are far enough along, start play and see if the game is actually any fun ðŸ™‚
