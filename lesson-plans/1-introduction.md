## {workload responsibility}

Coding can be challenging and we all need help debugging our code. There is a proper sequence to get help solving a problem.

**Step 1 -> Google It:** You will need to be independent in trying to solve your own problems. In class students get priority support from me. You will need to help yourself first.

**Step 2 -> Ask A Peer:** Ask someone else in the class if they have come across this problem before. Do this step only after you have attempted to solve it yourself.

**Step 3 -> Ask Me:** Your first steps should not be to ask for my help. There are many of you, one of me, and time is limited. Use me as an absolute last resort.

This tiered system is the most effective way for you to obtain help. It is also the most respectful of other peopleâ€™s time and energy as they are trying to tackle their own problems.
