Need Help? Read-Search-Ask
--------------------------

When you get stuck, remember: **Read-Search-Ask**.

1. **Read** the documentation or error
2. **Search** Google
3. **Ask** your friends for help
4. **Ask** the teacher

Do those steps in order. This is the most time-efficient way to handle being stuck, and it’s the most respectful of other people’s time, too.

Most of the time, you’ll solve your problem after doing a quick Google search or by trying to complete one or two steps of the problem.
