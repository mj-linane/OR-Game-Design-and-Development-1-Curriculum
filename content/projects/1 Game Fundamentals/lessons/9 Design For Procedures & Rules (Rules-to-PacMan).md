## Activities

—

1. Rules of Pac-Man
    1. Everyone plays a round of pacman
    2. Individual students sdesign the rules they are going to put into their draft game.

2. **THE RULES OF PAC-MAN**

    **Summary** Analyze the underlying rule-structures of Pac-Man and then visually communicate them to the class

    **Goals**

    - understand how Pac-Man works as a formal system
    - enumerate the rules that define one aspect of the structure of Pac-Man
    - communicate those rules to others

    **Before the exercise** Make sure that everyone understands the basics of how Pac-Man works. A video of the arcade version of the game is a good way to remind everyone of the basic game features.

    Then have the class brainstorm the types of rules that they want to analyze. Make a list of the general classes of rules and structures that make up Pac-Man. These might include *interactivity, scoring, game space*, *ghost behavior*, etc. Don’t get too hung up on finding the perfect categories - it’s OK if they overlap.

    **Analyze + Design!** Divide into groups. Each group takes one of the categories and has to dissect the structure of Pac-Man into the logical rules that define the behavior of that aspect of the game system.

    The second part of this exercise is to visualize the rules however the group wants. Using supplies like posterboard, markers, paper, scissors, etc. the groups can make lists, diagrams, puppet shows, skits – they can use whatever means they want to communicate the rules and structures they defined. I like to encourage groups to use as little text as possible and also to create something more than just text on a page.

    **Discuss & Critique** There is no right or wrong answer to this exercise. In fact, part of the point is to realize how many different ways there are to analyze the same game. Usually there end up being radically different approaches to understanding and visualizing rules, from complex equations of game icons to detailed maps and diagrams to interactive paper simulations.

    The critical discussion of each group’s work should focus on both aspects of the assignment: the rules-based analysis of the game, as well as the success of the visualization strategy.
