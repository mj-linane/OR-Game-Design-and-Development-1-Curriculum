History of Gameplay
-------------------

### Is playing games natural?

Playing games is a part of the human nature. How do we know? Small infants can play games. Dogs play games. [Fish play games.](http://techtimes.com/articles/18344/20141021/fish-play-for-fun-study.htm)

### When did we formalize board games?

Oldest board game in the world? *[Senet](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Senet)*. Originates from ancient Egypt, 3100 BC.

1. What experience/emotions do you want your players to have?
2. What is the playerâ€™s goal?
3. What/who is going to prevent the player from achieving that goal? How are they going to do that?

### Design Tips

1. Really focus on the first question: the experience of the player.
2. If you are stuck for ideas, consider: when, where would this event happen in real life?
3. Draft a couple of ideas before you settle on one. Donâ€™t let the first idea be the only idea.

### When done answering questions

1. Start to draft some of the rules of the game.
2. If you are far enough along, start play and see if the game is actually any fun ðŸ™‚
